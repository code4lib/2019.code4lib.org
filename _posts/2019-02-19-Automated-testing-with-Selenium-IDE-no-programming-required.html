<p>Automated testing is a key part of ensuring that the software we develop and provide works effectively and functionally. For the software used by patrons, automated testing can point us to the bugs we need to fix, or the issues that we need to report to software maintainers, before they cause problems for our users. In this hands-on workshop, we’ll start by discussing what automated testing is, different kinds of testing, and provide an overview of some commonly used tools and methods. Then, we’ll dive into how to scope and create automated tests using Katalon Recorder [1], a browser plugin for testing web-based software. Participants will work through several exercises, and will come away with an understanding of how to make their own automated tests without requiring programming knowledge.

<p>This workshop is beginner-friendly; no prior programming knowledge is required, but attendees will need to bring a laptop.
