title: Algorithm Bias Study
---
Recent discourse in information literacy has raised questions about bias in the Google search algorithm.  In our study, we consider whether pedagogy that raises awareness about how databases are designed by humans with pre-existing biases should be an important aspect of how librarians teach information literacy. As a first step in this process of developing information literacy modules for students about algorithmic bias, we surveyed computer science and engineering student population for their current perceptions about search engine and “big-data” algorithms. We will introduce the topic with a short summary of the book Algorithms of Oppression (2018) by Safiya Noble, present our preliminary findings and lessons learned, and conclude with proposed pathways for future research.
