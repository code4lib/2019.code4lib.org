This workshop is complementary with Forensic Files, Episode 1: “Fishing for the Truth” but attendance in the first workshop is not required.

This workshop will go through the steps necessary to preserve and grant access to digital cultural objects, and the decision-making process involved when working with files. We will follow objects through their life cycles, stopping to interrogate crucial preservation steps along the way, such as digitization, characterization, metadata extraction,  normalization, derivative generation, and presentation. We will discuss which tools are appropriate for each of the tasks, and what are the pitfalls to using these tools. We will also talk about resources that are available to help you determine the “just-right” level of preservation actions for your situation.

We are committed to making this a low-barrier session for those who are interested in learning more about preservation planning. No technical expertise is required of participants, although we will be discussing file formats and preservation tasks in detail.
