title: Get To Know WCAG 2.1
---
In the summer of 2018, W3C published a new version of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). WCAG 2.1 fills in gaps that were identified in WCAG 2.0 to improve accessibility across devices and for users with additional types of needs, particularly those with low vision or cognitive disabilities. This session will explain what developers and technologists need to know about these guidelines and how (and when) the guidelines will impact current practices. After this session, participants will have the information they need to decide whether and how to change the current accessibility policies and practices at their institution.
