title: Need a new discovery layer? TRLN Discovery project&#58; software and AWS architecture overview.
---
TRLN Discovery is a collaborative software development project which allows users to find materials from all Triangle Research Libraries Network member libraries within a single search environment. This poster will include a summary of the software developed for this project as well as the AWS technical infrastructure. It will include the developerâ€™s experience of using the software to transform, normalize and ingest library holdings into a consortial shared index and installing and customizing the discovery UI for one of the member universities. This content would be especially valuable for those who are looking for a solution to create or update a library or consortium level discovery service.
