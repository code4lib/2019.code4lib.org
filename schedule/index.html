                It is a Code4Lib tradition to welcome those who are new to the conference
                by organizing dinner groups on the night before the general conference begins.
                Sign-up is organized by the <a href="https://wiki.code4lib.org/Code4Lib_2018_Conference_Committees#Social_Activities_Committee">Social Activities Committee</a>
                on the wiki, and we try to mix a few newcomers with a few veterans
                who can offer an informal introduction to the conference.  Great for making new friends!

                    Play games? Have some homemade (or “homemade”) treats to share? Want to find folks to play music with? We organized a large open room near the conference center with plenty of space for attendees to gather and socialize, play games and share goodies. We will provide tables and chairs for Board Game Night and some space for jam sessions. You are also welcome to bring stuff to share, from craft sodas and beers to baked goods to local treats - we’ll have a few tables set up for that as well.
                </p>

                    The general conference is over, but if you have a bunch of inspired nerds with common interests in one spot, why not organize a little hackfest or meetup?  You are on your own to organize at this point, but feel free to contact the
                    <a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org/2017_Conference_Committees#Local_Planning_Committee">Local Planning Committee</a> if you would like assistance securing space.
