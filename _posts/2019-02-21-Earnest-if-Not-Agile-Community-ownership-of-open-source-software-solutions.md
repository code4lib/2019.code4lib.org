title: Earnest if Not Agile&#58; Community ownership of open source software solutions
---
The ISLE project is an attempt to apply contemporary deployment and maintenance solutions to the large Islandora digital repository stack. After the initial round of vendor-driven prototyping, a volunteer community took over ISLE maintenance and kicked off a second round of development and documentation. This poster session explores how the community worked to reconcile distributed volunteer work among team members (primarily developers and librarians in academic institutions) with a project structure initially created in a full-time software development environment.
