title: The Websites that Librarians Love... but are they ACCESSIBLE?!?
---
DuckDuckGo. LibGuides. Google Scholar. Libraries "love" these sites. Librarians recommend them. Our patrons sometimes use them. But is that a good thing? We have many metrics to evaluate how well a site performs. One of these (albeit often overlooked) is web accessibility. So how well do these sites fare when it comes to web accessibility. This talk will give an overview of each site's accessibility and highlight what is good and what is horrible. Simple accessibility tests and heuristics for anyone to use will be demonstrated. Learn which sites come out victorious and which ones fail horribly. Will your fave come out smelling like roses?
