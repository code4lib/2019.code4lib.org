title: Leveraging Serverless Technologies to Improve Library Workflows
---

Serverless computing: it may sound too good to be true, but it isn’t! Serverless is an emerging cloud-computing execution model in which server management issues are hidden from the developer. When deployed properly, this model allows you to focus on writing code, while your cloud provider takes care of “all that devops stuff.”

This workshop will provide an overview of the concepts of serverless, the major providers in the serverless space, related technologies, relevant languages and frameworks. Participants will discuss use cases where utilizing these technologies can improve library workflows, reduce costs and facilitate innovation. Workshop participants will work with several types of serverless code examples including:

* Serverless web application
* Scheduled and/or event triggered data sync
* AWS Lambda function to support Alexa skill
* AWS Lambda to send alerts
