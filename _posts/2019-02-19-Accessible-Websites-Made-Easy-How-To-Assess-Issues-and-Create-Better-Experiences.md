title: Accessible Websites Made Easy&#58; How To Assess Issues and Create Better Experiences
---

You need to make your website ADA compliant, whether it is WCAG or 508, but what does that actually mean? We’ll go over the basics of accessibility and how it relates to you, your users, and your website. We’ll dive into best practices for testing, recommended automated tools to use and demo a site with a screen reader to better understand your user experience. Attendees will audit their site for accessibility guidelines and then together, we will cover the standards for fixing and avoiding common issues. Attendees should bring a laptop. Some extensions may be recommended to download.

NOTE: The screen reader portion of this demo will be using Mac's proprietary screen reader "Voiceover (VO)" which will vary slightly from other assistive technologies like NVDA and Jaws.
