  poster-title: "Introducing Aurora, an open tool for standards-based digital records transfers"
  abstract: |
    Rockefeller Archive Center and Marist College have developed a web application to support the ongoing secure transfer of digital records from active organizations to archives. Named Aurora, the system is part of the Project Electron chain of tools that enables the archival management and preservation of born-digital records. Aurora ensures that transfers of digital records to archives are virus-free, consistently structured, and include required metadata elements. Specifying and enforcing a common baseline for transfers allows archivists to focus their attention on appraisal and sensemaking of these records, while facilitating automation of routine administrative activities. Aurora is built on community-driven standards and specifications (including BagIt, BagIt Profiles, and PREMIS rights statements), an open source web framework, and released as open source software.

  poster-title: "Enhancing Discovery through Integrated and Meaningful Metadata"
  abstract: |
    While libraries once offered only physical spaces and collections, they now offer much more - people with knowledge/technical expertise, event programming, services, and technologies that support a variety of activities. However, discovery tools and search engines have limited understanding of the dynamic nature of libraries. How might libraries leverage modern technologies to make their full range of offerings more discoverable through local tools, as well as web search engines? In this poster, I demonstrate how a library knowledge graph can improve a library’s discovery strategy by integrating data across silos, such as the ILS, repositories, and website, as well as enhancing this data through more meaningful metadata. I also illustrate use-cases and applications of a knowledge graph discovery strategy.

  poster-title: "The Need for a Library Diversity Webpage: Challenges, Opportunities and Expectations"
  abstract: |
    This poster presentation explores how one academic library launched the library diversity webpage after conducting a 6-month needs assessment to promote the library's interest and value for diversity and inclusion. Through collaboration and communication, the website represents the library's commitment to these values and supports the university's mission as well. This presentation will share best practices, challenges and expectations of creating and maintaining such information on the website: what content should be displayed, what are other academic library sites doing to promote diversity, and what learning management system would best to communicate diversity, inclusion and social justice in our library work? By having these discussions, academic libraries and library workers can rethink how their services, resources and outreach programs can enhance and strengthen diversity work in the library and across campus collaboratively. Attendees will also hear about the internal and external challenges when presenting for a case to launch a library diversity website.

  poster-title: "Project Management Managed: A case study of project automation in Digital Library Services"
  abstract: |
    Project management methods used in the Digital Library Services have been evolving, helping to keep communication lines open between multiple departments working on digitization, metadata, and digital preservation tasks. Our project management system began as a semi-organized set of paper forms that were not openly accessible to stakeholders. This evolved into an online form to gather information for project charter pages. We have recently migrated to tracking workflows through a project management system with the ability to automate management tasks. These changes have greatly improved communication, automated project tracking, and increased collaboration between departments. Our stakeholders are also better informed of the progress made on their digital projects. This poster will show how our project management methods have changed over time and include information about the different tools used to collect and track data about each project.

  poster-title: "Preparing for ArchivesSpace: Crosswalking Legacy Locations Data to Finding Aids at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"
  abstract: |
    The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill University Libraries recently kicked off a project to migrate over 5,000 hand-encoded finding aids and other archival information from a variety of mostly homegrown systems to ArchivesSpace. To prepare the data for ingest, we focused recent efforts on mapping locations data for our physical materials to container information in our finding aids. This proved less than straightforward for a variety of reasons, not limited to legacy data formatting, multiple file formats, different interpretations of container hierarchy, and flat file limitations. This poster will detail the steps taken to map semi-controlled locations data stored in a Microsoft Access database and an Excel spreadsheet to finding aid container data in XML format using Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) and the Ruby Roo and Nokogiri gems.

  poster-title: "Open Discovery for Open Data: An Open Source Index for Institutional Research Data"
  abstract: |
    Many libraries currently support two institutional repository systems—one for publications, and one for research data—even when there are nearly a thousand data repositories in the United States. To do so, we either increase spending by purchasing data repository solutions from vendors, or replicate work by building, customizing, and managing individual instances of data repository software. Especially for small and midsized institutions, this feels overwhelming to our limited resources. This poster suggests a potential solution: a centralized metadata store for datasets produced by an institution's researchers. With funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, we have created a prototype for an open source institutional research data index (IRDI) that promotes discovery of existing datasets that are housed in third-party repositories. Google Dataset Search has recently come onto the scene and piqued our imaginations around what is possible for research data discovery. IRDI complements Google Dataset Search, SHARE, DataMed, and other research data indexes, adding to the conversation a three-pronged focus. First, IRDI promotes discovery for institution-specific research datasets, thus allowing institutions to showcase research data as a scholarly product and a driver of institutional reputation. Second, IRDI provides newly-generated descriptive metadata for individual datasets, gleaned through topic mining of scholarly profile sources like ORCID and Google Scholar Profiles. Third, IRDI content is optimized for discovery by commercial search engines. IRDI is one step toward community-driven, community-owned index for academic institutional research data. Such an index would in turn not only increase discovery, reuse, and citation of open research data, but also act as an easy-to-implement, open source, library-built system. This presentation will demonstrate a prototype of IRDI, discuss challenges and opportunities, request feedback from the Code4Lib community, and generate discussion around open source data discovery tools.

  poster-title: "In a third space: Building a horizontally connected digital collections ecosystem"
  abstract: |
    The technology space of our digital collections ecosystem isn’t relegated to one vendor or to one IT department on campus - rather, it is placed in the hands of those with the best skills and expertise to provide that support.This poster will describe the integration and development of our digital collections infrastructure, which is comprised of ArchivesSpace (developed by the Digital Collections Services department), ArchivesDirect (hosted through Artefactual + Duraspace), a Node.js digital repository (developed by the Library Technology Services department), and Kaltura (developed by campus IT).Each system is a standalone product managed by a standalone group, resulting in a true hybrid architecture and a coordinated effort of digital curation activities that still allows for each group to focus on the service they have the most vested interest in providing. We will also talk about the different management and development practices for each system, and how we negotiate our partnership to support one another and provide digital collections as a service.

  poster-title: "Application of Boost Algorithm in Demand-Driven Acquisitions Prediction: A Machine-Learning Approach"
  abstract: |
    Demand-Driven Acquisitions (DDA) have played an important role in academic libraries. Identifying driving forces of the DDA process and therefore being able to predict the purchasing triggers are beneficial to library collection management, budget planning, librarians’ reference, and the understanding of patrons’ behaviors. However, the literature to date has shown a lack of robust and accurate solutions to the issue. We propose a machine-learning approach called adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) to predict DDA purchasing patterns. As we can show, the results of our simulation studies show that the boosting algorithm possesses higher predictability than traditional logistic regression—an analytic approach adopted in the most current literature. This presentation provides a useful quantitative toolkit for library applications of machine learning.

  poster-title: "Using web data for evidence-informed event management with R"
  abstract: |
    In the past few years, the University of Ottawa Library has significantly increased its outreach activities by sponsoring or co-sponsoring events in library spaces where rooms are equipped with cutting-edge technologies. As there are competing demands for library spaces, we have to prioritize requests in order to maximize their usage and provide our users with alternate spaces available on campus. However, there was no information about how campus spaces were used for events based on their types. Since uoCal, the online campus-wide calendar of events, contains comprehensive information on campus events, we decided to utilize uoCal data to analyze and visualize how campus spaces have been used based on event types and hours in order to make evidence-informed decisions. In this poster, we will demonstrate how we scraped thousands of event data available since 2011 from the uoCal website, conducted data wrangling for further data analysis, visualized datasets on the campus map, and analyzed datasets to answer our questions using R. We will also discuss challenges about web data scraping, especially large datasets from different web pages and data munging processes. Lastly, we will share our reproducible R scripts so that other people can re-use them for their purpose.

  poster-title: "Three Strategic Interventions to Improve the Findability of Enterprise Content"
  abstract: |
    For any organization with significant digital content, the ability to search across this content has become an operational necessity. Despite this, unified enterprise search and retrieval of digital content remains an elusive goal for many organizations. A further complication rests on the fact that, regardless of the specific content management system (CMS) used by an organization, effective enterprise content findability requires some manual review and editing in order to produce results that meet users' expectations.This presentation highlights work that librarians and information specialists at JPL have done to strategically intervene in the creation and maintenance of JPL’s intranet. Three key interventions are discussed which best highlight how work in enterprise ""knowledge curation” fits into emergent knowledge management roles for institutional librarians. These three interventions are: 1) guided document creation, which includes the development of wiki portals and standard editing processes for consistent knowledge capture, 2) search curation, which includes manual and organic enterprise search relevancy improvements, and 3) index as intervention, which describes how metadata mapping and information modeling are used to improve access to content for both local and enterprise-wide applications. As organizations and their workers become increasingly reliant on shared digital resources to complete work tasks, librarians and other information professionals must decide what our roles will be in facilitating information capture and findability in an enterprise information ecosystem. Through a description of the JPL Library’s intranet improvement activities, this paper will set the stage for further conversations on the role of the information professional in improving institutional digital asset management and knowledge management. This work was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

  poster-title: "Collections as Data: Machine-readable interfaces for digital collections "
  abstract: |
    Galleries, Museums, Libraries and Archives (GLAM) have been digitizing textual documents, images, records and serving them online for many years. In many cases, even though the digitized content is openly available to the public, the web interfaces were designed for humans to consume the information. Treating “collections as data” is gaining traction in the library world, and, a well-structured data archive, supported with the right tools, will enable research scholars and interested and curious community members to ask questions and draw interesting patterns from the archive.As part of our ongoing efforts to leverage technology and enhance our digital collections, we are adding machine-friendly interfaces to our digitized content. The pilot project is focused on the historical newspapers archive. The interface acts as an intermediary that transforms requests and responses, in between the client (software programs) and the data archive.In this poster, we will talk about the importance of looking at collections as data, our work with digital collections and demonstrate the usefulness of this approach with specific examples.

  poster-title: "The Redundancy of Legal Scholarship Repositories: The Current Landscape and Future Directions"
  abstract: |
    Currently, the typical law librarian with the responsibility of maintaining a legal scholarship repository for his/her institution duplicates the repository submission process several times in some instances. It is becoming commonplace for the same law review article to simultaneously appear in a pre-print repository, a post-print repository, an institutional repository, a dark archive, and on the faculty member's College profile. What is gained and what is lost in this process? How can we identify redundancies and streamline the submission process? This poster will visualize the current technological environment, and contextualize systems and workflows, revealing the greater issues involved in the decision-making process for law librarians seeking to make their faculty's scholarship open and accessible to the broadest possible audience.

  abstract: |
    This poster will discuss how today’s advanced technology driven by big data and machine learning, a sub-field of artificial intelligence (AI) research, bring up certain ethical problems, which programmers and technologists are ill prepared to handle. Those ethical problems exist in a wide range from data privacy to decision-making in tricky situations. What is the responsibility of programmers and technologists in developing and implementing AI applications? How should programmers and technologists approach the task of identifying and articulating the potential social and/or organizational implications that may follow from newly proposed technology solutions? This poster will explore practical ways to address aforementioned issues and to monitor the result and mitigate potential side effects of a decision on an ongoing basis. The trolley problem in moral philosophy and the autonomous driving technology will be discussed as examples.
