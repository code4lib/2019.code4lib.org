<p>
    Work is beginning to transform the eloquent yet arcane texts called
    "library cataloging records" into data elements that will play well in
    the Web. Beginning with the upcoming revised cataloging rules, called
    Resource Description and Access, a team of researchers is exploring the
    abstract model behind bibliographic description. Coyle will cover the
    philosophy behind the project and will discuss current progress and
    goals, as well as fears, risks, and even some confusion.
