You've got an idea that you think might solve a problem for your users, but so much is standing in your way.  You don't have the time (nor permission!) to derail your day job on a concept that might not even pan out. In this session, attendees will learn how to apply Eric Reis' Lean Startup concepts to projects in order to vet new ideas quickly, cheaply, and with scientific rigor - the way many successful startups in Silicon Valley do.  Quickly develop the seeds of a good idea into something that is undeniably great or learn lessons for the future by failing fast and risking little. This workshop will apply the methods of the Startup Way to real problems, starting with the forming of an idea to having real data that points the way forward.

NOTE: While the presenters are from EBSCO, the content and opinions in the workshop are our own and will not include mention of any EBSCO products, we solemnly swear.
