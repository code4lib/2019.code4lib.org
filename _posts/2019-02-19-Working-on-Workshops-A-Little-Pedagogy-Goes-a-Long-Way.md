The NCSU libraries led 327 workshops last year. Our workshops cover a wide array of topics including: Arduino, R, digital media, citation management, and systematic reviews. Developing these workshops takes time and effort. Through our experience, we have adopted strategies that demystify workshop design.

In this workshop, we will share best practices, lessons learned the hard way, and a framework for workshop development. Bring your idea or existing workshop materials to overhaul; leave with a finished outline for a new workshop, access to NCSU Libraries workshop materials, and a set of helpful steps to go through when designing a new workshop.

Participants will learn how to design a workshop using backward design: starting with learning outcomes, moving through assessment, intro activities and outlines.
