title: Maximizing library inventories
---
<p>Although a decreasing part of our overall library budgets, print books continue to provide immense value to our patrons, occupying much of our spaces. Despite advances in inventory technology many libraries may still be using legacy inventory systems to help compare what should be on the shelf with what is on the shelf, in the right order. During this workshop we will explore how to maximize your use of open source technology during the course of a print inventory in Google sheets.</p>
