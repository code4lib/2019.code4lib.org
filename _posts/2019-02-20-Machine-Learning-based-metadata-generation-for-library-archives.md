title: Machine Learning based metadata generation for library archives
---
As libraries and cultural heritage organizations continue to acquire and digitize cultural and historical treasures, in the hopes of making them available to the general public, it is important to create quality descriptive metadata to increase the visibility of content. Creating quality metadata is a time-consuming process, and not all organizations may have enough metadata experts to describe the content quickly & accurately. We received funding from LYRASIS Catalyst grant to explore opportunities in using Machine Learning technology to simplify descriptive metadata generation for historical images. We will share updates on our work so far with a particular focus on the tools, techniques, and the outcomes of the project.
