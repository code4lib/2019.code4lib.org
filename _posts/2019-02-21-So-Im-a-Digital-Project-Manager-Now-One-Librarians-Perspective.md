title: So I’m a Digital Project Manager Now?&#58; One Librarian’s Perspective
---
More so than ever, librarians are transitioning into digital project manager roles, as cultural heritage institutions of all sizes increasingly support and develop open-source solutions for library technology. In this poster presentation, I will share some tips and ideas for those who are in the process of (or interested in) making this career shift, drawing from my own professional experience. In particular, I will be highlighting skill building around agile project management principles and tackling often overlooked challenges, such as imposter syndrome and changing organizational structures.
