title: Representing diversity on the web&#58; How to create inclusive virtual campus environments
---
<p>Diversity and inclusivity is the focus of many of our academic institutions’ mission statements - but does your website reflect these standards?
Often unconscious, wrong decisions on copy and multimedia content can create an unwelcoming virtual environment to underrepresented groups. This might cause prospective students or faculty/staff to choose a different school/employer, or discourage current students and employees from seeking support and finding diversity resources and content on the web. Additionally, if your content is not accessible, you are excluding a wide variety of users.

My workshop will help to identify and avoid common pitfalls and educate attendees on solutions for improving your institute’s online presence.
We’ll be looking at various nation-wide examples from around the web and social media and learn to create accessible, inclusive digital content.
