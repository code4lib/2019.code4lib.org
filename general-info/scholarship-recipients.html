                <p>
                    The Scholarship Committee is pleased to announce the Code4Lib 2017 Conference Diversity Scholarship awardees.
                    Through the generosity of {{ sponsors.name | join: ", " }}, Bess Sadler and Mark Bussey and the Code4lib
                    community we were able to award twelve $1,200 scholarships to defray costs associated with attending the conference.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We received a large number of applications from highly qualified candidates this year, and it was a humbling
                    experience for the committee to select just twelve awardees. Congratulations to all Code4Lib scholarship recipients!
                </p>
                <p>
