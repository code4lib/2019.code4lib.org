title: Why building a complete index of open access to research articles is hard and how you can help
---
Our nonprofit has gathered every open access scholarly article--over 20 million of them--into one free database. Come hear about the obstacles in assembling the index: confusing definitions!  poor metadata quality!  standards that weren't standard!  And more!  We'll detail the issues, how we've overcome them with a completely open-source solution, and how you can help :)
