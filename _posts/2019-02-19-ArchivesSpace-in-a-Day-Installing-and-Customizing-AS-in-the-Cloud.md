title: ArchivesSpace in a Day&#58; Installing and Customizing AS in the Cloud
---

Are you part of a small library or a lone arranger? Does your archives need an online portal to your finding aids? ArchivesSpace (AS) is rapidly becoming the standard application in the field but setting up an instance can be intimidating for small institutions. Intended for beginning AS users, this session will cover creating a cloud-based server, installing and running AS, customizing the theme and settings, and finally creating a reverse proxy for displaying the front end application online with a clean URL.

Participants will learn: Setting up a Linux based cloud server on AWS, including security settings and permissions. Downloading and installing AS with a quick overview of the staff and public interface. Configuring and creating a theme for AS using simple plugins. Setting up a reverse proxy to direct web traffic to your AS instance with a clean URL. Other topics such as upgrading AS and installing an SSL certificate might be covered, time permitting. Participants will need a personal computer with a working SSH client and a basic understanding of command line tools.
