title: We Are Family&#58; Collaborating on the Disco Index Project
---
The MIT Libraries has recently experimented with creating our own Discovery Index, an indexing platform that will be used to populate searches and discovery from multiple sources across the Libraries via a public API. The “Disco Index” will allow us to rely less on vended sources while maintaining more control over our privacy and metadata. During this foundational exploration into creating the Disco Index, engineers teamed up with catalogers to analyze and map data elements from our library catalog. In this presentation we will discuss the project, plus how we worked together to demystify engineering and MARC, and learned a lot about each other’s work.
