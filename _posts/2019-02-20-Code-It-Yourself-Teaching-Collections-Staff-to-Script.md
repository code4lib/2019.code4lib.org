title: Code It Yourself! Teaching Collections Staff to Script
---
We will share the University of Georgia Libraries' method for training collections staff to script using Python through a combination of a peer learning group and expert training from our Libraries' developer. The peer learning group (Lib Learn Tech) provides a support group for staff to work through online training together to learn Python basics. Our developer's workshops bridge the gap between learning about Python and being able to solve real-world problems using scripts such as renaming files, organizing files, and automatically running reports. These workshops emphasize how to think like and problem solve like a programmer so staff will be able to tackle additional problems on their own. Our goal is to cultivate an empowered staff who can script routine tasks, freeing up their (and our developer's) time for more complex pursuits.
