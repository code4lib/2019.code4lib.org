title: Enrich Library Collection Analysis using Python
---
At our library, we have initiated a new project to harvest data from the CrossRef API using Python in order to understand faculty publication and citation preferences. I’ll present how we can query data based on author, DOI, or title. I’ll describe how I pull and parse the JSON data using Python. Parsing steps include data validation, cleaning, etc. Finally, I’ll describe how I export the data to MySQL for additional processing to integrate with subject-based collection analysis reports.
