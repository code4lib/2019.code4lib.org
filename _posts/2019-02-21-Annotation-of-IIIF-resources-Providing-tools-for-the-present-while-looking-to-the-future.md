title: Annotation of IIIF resources&#58; Providing tools for the present while looking to the future
---
This poster will discuss and display a new open source JavaScript library for presenting annotations of IIIF resources. The library embeds an annotation or annotation listâ€™s image objects, notes, and tags into an HTML object. This rich display of annotations demonstrates the reuse value of annotations and provides the opportunity for new forms of scholarly output. Annotations also enable discovery and provide the opportunity for collaborative discussions, commenting, and tagging. This poster will give an introduction to annotations, demonstrate the low barrier of entry to using the library, challenges around creating and using annotations of IIIF resources from multiple data models, potential use cases, and future development opportunities.
