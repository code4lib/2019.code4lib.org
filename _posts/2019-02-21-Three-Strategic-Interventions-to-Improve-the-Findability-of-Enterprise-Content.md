title: Three Strategic Interventions to Improve the Findability of Enterprise Content
---
For any organization with significant digital content, the ability to search across this content has become an operational necessity. Despite this, unified enterprise search and retrieval of digital content remains an elusive goal for many organizations. A further complication rests on the fact that, regardless of the specific content management system (CMS) used by an organization, effective enterprise content findability requires some manual review and editing in order to produce results that meet users' expectations.

This presentation highlights work that librarians and information specialists at JPL have done to strategically intervene in the creation and maintenance of JPL’s intranet. Three key interventions are discussed which best highlight how work in enterprise "knowledge curation” fits into emergent knowledge management roles for institutional librarians. These three interventions are:

1. guided document creation, which includes the development of wiki portals and standard editing processes for consistent knowledge capture,
2. search curation, which includes manual and organic enterprise search relevancy improvements, and
3. index as intervention, which describes how metadata mapping and information modeling are used to improve access to content for both local and enterprise-wide applications.

As organizations and their workers become increasingly reliant on shared digital resources to complete work tasks, librarians and other information professionals must decide what our roles will be in facilitating information capture and findability in an enterprise information ecosystem. Through a description of the JPL Library’s intranet improvement activities, this paper will set the stage for further conversations on the role of the information professional in improving institutional digital asset management and knowledge management. This work was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
