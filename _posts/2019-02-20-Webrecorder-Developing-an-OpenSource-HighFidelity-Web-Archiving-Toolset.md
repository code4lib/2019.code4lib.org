title: Webrecorder&#58; Developing an Open-Source High-Fidelity Web Archiving Toolset
---
The talk will present the open source technology stack that powers Webrecorder and address some of the many challenges and possible solutions facing web archiving today. First, it will include a brief technical overview of high-fidelity web capture and replay, and general approaches to make high-fidelity web content accessible in the future will be presented. A practical guide to the open source tools developed as part of the Webrecorder toolset will also be included, aiming to help users and developers of all levels to improve their understanding, usage and creation of web archives to meet their personal and institutional needs. At the end, I hope to leave some time to answer any general questions about Webrecorder or web archiving technology in general.
