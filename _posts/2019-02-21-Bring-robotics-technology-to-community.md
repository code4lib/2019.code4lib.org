---
This poster shares the use of robot as a vehicle for guiding the community toward an effective understanding of coding principles and the future of robotics technology. Palo Alto City Library is experimenting with a humanoid programmable robot nicknamed Dewey. Dewey has been used in a 5-month coding program. It has also been integrated in many other library programs, events and conferences.
