title: Library apps and the modern dev workflow
---

Dev-ops, continuous deployment, serverless, cloud, API mocking, SPAs- terms which didn’t exist just a few years ago and are now firmly entrenched in the modern development workflow. These concepts can be overwhelming to all but the most experienced developers. In this session, we’ll build a library application taking advantage of such tools as OpenAPI, Swagger and Heroku and try to demystify some concepts along the way.
