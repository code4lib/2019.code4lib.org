<p>The Hesburgh Libraries have been using NiFi, an Apache data routing, processing and transformation tool, for a increasing number of applications including patron loading, Git pipelines and student billing. This session will include an introduction to NiFi and demo of a few of our NiFi-based services, followed by a hands-on workshop where participants will build their own flows.</p>
