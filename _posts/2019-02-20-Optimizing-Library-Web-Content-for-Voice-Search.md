title: Optimizing Library Web Content for Voice Search
---
About 20% of Google searches are currently voice searches. By 2020, it is likely that 50% of all searches in the United States will be done by voice. How can libraries ensure that the content we provide is adapted and optimized for people searching from their mobile devices or voice-activated assistants like Alexa, Siri, Cortana, and Google Home? Voice search has significant ramifications for online strategy. How can we ensure that libraries aren't left behind when half the population is searching through a virtual assistant? From Alexa Skills to structured data, this session will provide tips, tools and best practices for optimizing library-specific content for voice search.
