title: Wait, what? Getting your bearings with ServerSpec
---

Library developers change jobs, we're always the newbie. ServerSpec is a fantastic tool for keeping track of exactly what is supposed to be running on which server. Chances are such tests don't exist in your current workplace; chances are such tests would be significantly helpful to your coworkers. This is a tool that should be in your box.

Participants will learn to write simple yet efficient ServerSpec tests, how to organize them and invoke them for different machines, ways to approach managing many tests, and ways to incorporate them into project life cycles.

We will also briefly talk about other infrastructure testing frameworks; why you would consider them instead of ServerSpec, and why you will probably want to use ServerSpec anyway, warts and all.

Pre-requirements: participants should bring a notebook computer, with Virtualbox and Vagrant already installed, if you wish to follow along with the presented material. Interested spectators are welcome, however, you'll get more out of the workshop if you participate. You'll get the most out of this workshop if your day to day work has you installing services on servers (or you do so in your spare time for your own projects). You should probably be comfortable on a command line, and with the Linux bash shell. A passing familiarity with RSpec would help but isn't required.
