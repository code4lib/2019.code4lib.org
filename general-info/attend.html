                    <li>
                        The registration system maintains a two hour session per registration
                        attempt. Due to the potential of heavy access and this prolonged session,
                        the conference may appear to sell out quickly. But once early failed
                        sessions expire, more spots may open up beginning around 2 p.m. Because of
                        this we ask you not to assume it is sold out until you hear an announcement
                        from the planning committee.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Registration will close when the maximum capacity has been reached.
                        A waitlist will be available once this final round of registration is
                        closed.

                        The conference program is not complete at this time.
                        See <a href="http://vote.code4lib.org/election/results/42/">the election results</a> to get an idea of what will be part of the program.
                        This list represents the presentation voting results.
                        As in recent years, the remainder of the program
                        will be curated by the program committee, taking into account voting
                        results, topic diversity, and speaker diversity. These selections will be
                        announced in coming weeks.

                        Registration will include the option to select preconference workshops.
                        You can view workshops as part of the registration form to get an
                        idea of what will be offered. Wait lists will be available for
                        workshops, and you will receive relevant instructions with your
                        confirmation email.
