This workshop is complementary with Forensic Files, Episode 2: "A Purr-fect Match" but attendance in the second workshop is not required.

What even are files - and what’s a format? What about video, which is several formats making up one file? And what about disk images, with many files inside? And what about Google Docs, which aren’t even files at all?!

In this session, we will look at what makes up a file, how formats are defined, and how to analyze files for digital preservation. We’ll take a look at format registries like PRONOM and the Library of Congress Format Descriptions, check out some file analysis tools like Siegfried, JHOVE, and MediaInfo, and - as a hands-on exercise - use a hex editor to look at files and make sense of them.

We are committed to making this a low-barrier session for those who are interested in learning more about file formats. No technical expertise is required of participants, although we will be discussing file formats in detail. Attendees should bring a laptop or similar device that will enable them to participate in activities.
