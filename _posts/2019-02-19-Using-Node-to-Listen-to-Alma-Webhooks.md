title: Using Node to Listen to Alma Webhooks
---

Heard about the Alma Webhooks? They may help you build robust functionality outside of Alma to enhance existing functionality or provide features which are not built in to Alma. Alma has webhooks for jobs ending, notifications, requests, users, loans, and bib and item updates. Participants will learn the basics of setting up and running a Node app, writing a listener for a webhook, and we'll build some functionality triggered by webhook actions.
