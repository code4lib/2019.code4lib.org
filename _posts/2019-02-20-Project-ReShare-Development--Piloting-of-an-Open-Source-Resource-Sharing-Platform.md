title: Project ReShare&#58; Development & Piloting of an Open Source Resource Sharing Platform
---
Libraries desire a user-centered resource sharing state, where patrons have seamless and informed access to information in any library, in any format. ReShare, as an open source, community-owned resource sharing platform, will significantly expand librariesâ€™ current resource sharing capabilities and capacity, putting the patron and learner at the center of our collective collections ecosystem, with technology and/or profit playing a secondary role in facilitating access, rather than defining it. Consortia in the U.S. and abroad represent thousands of individual libraries operating resource sharing within commercially imposed technology silos. ReShare will provide a platform that any library/consortium may use to expand sharing within and between networks, regardless of choice of integrated library or discovery system to build capacity, saving time and money, while simultaneously supporting teaching, learning, and research activities.
